## Mouse Overheating \(Now with this code your mouse can overheat\!\)


</div>

### Description

This is pretty funny, I slapped it together when I had the idea.. If you move your mouse around too fast your mouse will overheat and stop moving. If you keep moving your mouse it will take longer for your mouse to get moving again. Try it out to see what I mean.
